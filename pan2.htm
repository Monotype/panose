alphabet or script that is being described is signified by the Family 
Kind digit. This digit consists of two parts: the script kind identifier
 and the genre kind identifier. In this case, the script identifier is 
Latin, and the genre type is described as Text, Hand Written, Decorative
 or Symbol. Extensions of the PANOSE system to other families of writing
 forms (Kanji, Hebrew, Arabic, etc.) have not been defined at the time 
this revision was written; <a href="http://www.monotype.com/company/contact/">contact us</a> for more information about the extensions that are currently available.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The Family Kind digit is not 
controlled by specific measurements, and there has been no attempt to 
mathematically determine the appropriate category for a given font 
design. Visual and aesthetic classification of Latin faces that are 
obviously script, decorative, or symbol fonts is required.</font></p>

                  The height of the serif, or SerTall(<a href="#Fig3SerifMeasurments">Figure 3</a>),
 is a vertical measurement taken on the lower left corner of the 
uppercase I, from the point that the serif departs from the vertical

 measurement describes the horizontal radius of the oval often formed 
when the serif connects to the stem. This measurement is taken on the 
uppercase I glyph. The HipRad is the distance from the theoretical left 
edge of the stem on the lower left serif to either the left edge of the 
serif or the point where the curve becomes tangent with a line extending
 to the left edge of the serif.</font></p>

serifed designs and cannot be measured on a serif whose HipRad value is 
equal to the SerWidL value. Drop assumes that there is a straight line 
between the left edge of the serif tip and the lowest extent of the 
HipRad. Drop measures the vertical distance from the top of the serif 
tip to the point of tangency with the bottom of the cove curve. As with

                <p><font class="copyright">As illustrated above, 
different paths may yield the same classification result. This occurs 
when a lesser trait is used to isolate a serif early in the process.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright"><b><i>Start</i></b><br>
                  The first step in classifying a serif design is to 
distinguish between the serif letterforms and the sans serif 
letterforms. The FootRat variable is used to make this first 
determination. If the FootRat value is less than or equal to 1.6, then 
the serif is further classified using the “Sans Serif Classification” 
description below. If the FootRat variable exceeds 1.6 the typeface is 
further classified as a serif design. (Note: If the FootRat variable 
exceeds 1.6 and the uppercase A, E, H, and N glyphs are sans serif, 
measure FootWid and WStem on the left stem of the uppercase H and 
recalculate FootRat.) This categorization of serifs based on the stem 
width at the base of the character allows some slight serifs to fall 
into the sans serif classification. This is expected. Similarly, later 
evaluation of some serif designs will cause them to revert back to a 
flared sans serif classification.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The description for further classification of serifed faces is continued after the <i> “Sans Serif Classification” </i>parameters detailed below.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright"><b><i>Sans Serif Classification</i></b><br>
                  Classifying sans serif designs is a simple process of 
elimination. If the uppercase E, A, and N glyphs are serifed and the 
TipRat variable is greater than or equal to 0.1, jump to “<a href="#SerifClassification">Serif Classification”</a> below.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The flared serif design is 
the first sans serif style that is isolated and eliminated. These 
designs are typified by stems that widen slightly at their base. Again, 
the FootRat variable is used to identify these designs. In addition, the
 SerProp variable is used to check that the widening is not simply the 
attribute of a concave stem. If the FootRat value exceeds 1.05, and the 
SerProp is less than 0.35, then the letterform is classified as 
14-Flared. All other combinations require further classification as 
described below.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The rounded sans serif 
designs are identified next. For this classification the RonRat variable
 is evaluated. If the RonRat value is less than 0.2 then the stem end is
 not considered rounded. If the RonRat value is greater or equal to 0.2 
then the Serif Style is classified as 15-Rounded.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The slant of the bottom of 
the leg end of non perpendicular stems are now analyzed to isolate the 
perpendicular sans serif designs. If the FootPitch is equal to zero, 
then the stem end is not considered serifed. If the FootPitch is greater
 than zero, then the design is classified as 13-Perpendicular Sans 
Serif.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">Finally, the remaining sans 
serif designs are divided into two categories: obtuse and normal. This 
classification is very similar to the obtuse and non-obtuse 
classifications provided for serif designs, yet in this case, both 
obtuse and acute vertical stem ends are classified together. If the 
SerOb value is either greater than or equal to 1.03 or less than or 
equal to 0.97, then the design is classified as 12-Obtuse Sans Serif. On
 the other hand, if the SerOb value is both less than 1.03 and greater 
than 0.97, then the design is classified as 11-Normal Sans Serif.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright"><a name="SerifClassification" target="_blank"></a><b><i>Serif Classification</i></b><br>
                  The first step of the serif classification is to 
divide the serif designs into flat-sided serifs and non-flat (pointed or
 rounded) serifs. TipRat and FlatRat are used to evaluate the design of 
the serif tip. Serifs whose FlatRat exceeds 0.8 are non-flat. Serifs 
whose TipRat is less than or equal to 0.25 are considered non-flat. All 
remaining serifs are flat.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The flat serifs are evaluated
 to isolate non-symmetrical serif designs. This is accomplished by 
comparing the width of the left side of the serif to the width of the 
right side of the serif using the SymRat variable. Serifs with SymRat 
values greater than 1.2 or less than 0.85 are considered asymmetrical. 
These asymmetrical serif designs are classified with the Serif Style 
digit 9-Exaggerated. The tolerances provided around the SymRat value 
allow slightly asymmetrical serifs to be categorized as symmetrical, and
 thus avoid being classified as exaggerated.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The flat serifs are further 
divided into Cove and Non-cove. A cove serif is identified when the 
upper connection of the serif to the stem is a curve tangent to the 
stem. The HipRat variable is used to isolate the cove serifs. Serifs 
whose HipRat is greater than 0.1 are considered coved. If the serif’s 
HipRat is less than or equal to 0.1, the serif design is considered 
non-coved. These two serif styles are further classified below in the 
two sections “Cove” and “Non-cove.”</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">Only the non-flat serifs isolated above require the classification defined in the next four paragraphs.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">Two criteria are applied to 
the non-flat serifs to remove exaggerated serif styles. First the 
CuspRat variable is used to classify those serif designs that have 
unusually high dishing or cusping on the lower side of the serif. If the
 CuspRat is greater than 0.15, then the serif is considered extremely 
cusped and is therefore classified as 9-Exaggerated.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">Similarly, serifs which are 
highly elongated are classified as exaggerated serifs. The SerSize 
variable is used to identify these serifs. If SerSize exceeds 0.19, then
 the serif is classified as 9-Exaggerated. If the serif size is 
exaggerated for the uppercase I glyph, verify that it remains 
exaggerated on the lower left-hand serif of the uppercase H glyph. Note:
 Use samples of the same point size when comparing the stem widths. Some
 formulas may have to be recalculated to compare against the proper stem
 width.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The remaining serifs are 
divided into two camps: pointed serifs and rounded serifs. The TRadAv 
variable is used to isolate these two styles. Since the TRad variables 
indicate the roundness of the serif tip, the average of the upper and 
lower edges of the tip will be greater than zero for any serif whose tip
 is not pointed or squarely flattened. Hence if TRadAv &gt; 0, then the 
serif is further classified as a rounded serif; if TRadAv <font face="Symbol">£ </font>0,
 then the serif is further classified as pointed. See the two sections 
“Rounded” and “Pointed” below for additional classification requirements
 of the serif designs.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright"><b><i>Cove</i></b><br>
                  The flat and cove serifs require additional 
classification in order to separate them into the proper category. The 
first step is to determine the amount of drop from the height of the 
serif to the top of the tip. This relationship is described by the 
DropRat variable. If the DropRat value is greater than 0.2, then the 
serif is classified as steep. If the DropRat is less than or equal to 
0.2, then the serif is categorized as shallow. Steep serifs require two 
more classification steps. Shallow serifs require only the following 
step.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">Shallow serifs are divided 
into Obtuse and Non-obtuse serifs. This process is used in several areas
 throughout the classification of Serif Styles. Consequently this 
detailed information is repeated in each area to ease navigation of this
 document.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The SerOb variable is used to
 identify those serif styles that do not form square corners but rather 
relax into a wider obtuse angle. If SerOb is greater than 0.93, then the
 serif is classified as 4-Square Cove serif. If the SerOb value is less 
than or equal to 0.93, then the serif is classified as 5-Obtuse Square 
Cove serif.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The steep serifs isolated 
above by the DropRat variable are further classified to isolate the 
triangular serifs. If the cove on the serif covers less than roughly one
 third of the serif width, the serif is classified as a triangle. Hence,
 if HipRat <font face="Symbol">£ </font>0.35, then the serif is classified as 10-Triangle serif.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">For serifs that have a HipRat
 greater than 0.35, a final refinement into obtuse and non-obtuse serifs
 is required. This follows the same logic described above using the 
SerOb variable. If SerOb is greater than 0.93, then the serif is 
classified as 4-Square Cove serif. If on the other hand, the SerOb value
 is less than or equal to 0.93, then the serif is classified as 5-Obtuse
 Square Cove serif.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright"><i><b>Non-cove</b></i><br>
                  Of the three possible outcomes for a flat, non-cove 
serif design, the triangular serifs are isolated first. A comparison 
between the height of the serif tip and the overall height of the serif 
is used to make this determination. If StepRat is less than or equal to 
0.85, then the upper serif edge is steep enough to be classified as 
10-Triangular serif. If the StepRat is greater than 0.85, then the serif
 requires further classification as described below.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The remaining flat, non-coved
 serifs are divided into two categories, thin serifs and square serifs. 
This is accomplished by once again referring to the TipRat variable. If 
the TipRat value is greater than 0.35, then the serif is classified as 
6-Square serif. If, however, the TipRat is less than or equal to 0.35, 
the serif is classified as 7-Thin serif.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright"><b><i>Pointed</i></b><br>
                  The pointed serifs are now checked to determine if 
they fall into the class of minute serifs in the Flared serif category. 
The SerSize variable is used to isolate the flared serifs. If the 
SerSize is less than or equal to 0.09 then the serif is classified as 
14-Flared. A SerSize greater than 0.09 is considered normal and the 
design requires further classification.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The Triangle Serifs are also 
separated in this path of the classification. The HipRat variable 
indicates the proportion of the cove of the serif to the overall serif 
width. If the HipRat is less than 0.3, then the serif is classified as a
 10-Triangle serif.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">Pointed serifs with a HipRat 
variable greater than or equal to 0.3 are classified into one of two 
remaining categories: obtuse and non-obtuse. The SerOb variable 
identifies those serif styles that do not form square corners but rather
 relax into a wider obtuse angle. If SerOb is greater than 0.93, then 
the serif is classified as 2-Cove serif. If on the other hand the SerOb 
value is less than or equal to 0.93, then the serif is classified as 
3-Obtuse Cove serif.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright"><b><i>Rounded</i></b><br>
                  As with the flat serifs above, the first criteria used
 to further classify the rounded serifs is the size of the cove or 
curved connection joining the serif to the stem. If the HipRat variable 
has a value greater than 0.15, then the serif requires additional 
classification as a coved rounded serif. However, if the HipRat is less 
than or equal to 0.15, then the serif is treated as if it has no 
rounding to the corner and is classified as 7-Thin.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">At this point the SerRat 
variable is used to identify those serif designs that are unusually deep
 or oval from the rounded, coved serifs. If SerRat is greater than or 
equal to 0.55 then the Serif Style is classified as 8-Oval. Note: the 
8-Oval Serif Style was originally referred to as the 8-Bone Serif Style 
or the 8-Heavy Serif Style. The new term, 8-Oval, replaces the terms 
8-Bone and 8-Heavy.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">The remaining rounded serifs 
are divided into two categories: obtuse and non-obtuse. This process is 
identical to the process described in the pointed serif classification. 
The SerOb variable is used to identify those serif styles that do not 
form square corners but rather relax into a wider obtuse angle. If SerOb
 is greater than 0.93, then the serif is classified as 2-Cove serif. If 
on the other hand the SerOb value is less than or equal to 0.93, then 
the serif is classified as 3-Obtuse Cove serif.</font></p>

 this has provided reasonable averages for the ranges of weights, these

                <p><font class="copyright">The objective of the 
Proportion category is to evaluate the relative widths of specific 
characters and assign the typeface into one of nine PANOSE Proportion 
digits. This is accomplished by first removing the non-normal 
proportioned glyphs and then segmenting the remaining designs into one 
of three normal proportion genres. These variables are set up such that 
the character widths themselves are not evaluated but rather the aspect 
ratios of these glyphs by setting them against a calculated Em width.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">To isolate monospaced font 
designs, the ratio of the width of the uppercase J to the width of the 
uppercase M (JMRat) is evaluated. More than any other two characters in 
the Latin glyph set, these two characters can readjust their character 
shape in order to better conform to a uniformly spaced font. If the 
JMRat is greater than or equal to 0.78 the font is classified as 
9-Monospaced. The monospaced fonts are classified first because they are
 often condensed in appearance in addition to being monospaced in 
design.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">For those fonts not 
classified as monospaced, the shape of the uppercase O is evaluated to 
identify unusually narrow or wide glyph shapes. The ratio of the width 
to the height of the uppercase O glyph is reflected in the ORat 
variable. If ORat is greater than or equal to 1.27, the font is 
classified as 6-Condensed. Further, if ORat is greater than or equal to 
2.0, the PANOSE digit for Proportion is 8-Very Condensed.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">Similarly, the extended fonts
 are also identified by examining the ORat variable. In this case the 
font is classified as 5-Extended if ORat is greater than or equal to 
0.90 and less than 0.92. If the ORat value is less than 0.90 the font is
 further classified as 7-Very Extended.</font></p>
                <p><font class="copyright">Finally, those fonts not yet 
classified are evaluated by stricter criteria to separate them into 
three normal proportion schemes. The PropRat value can be inserted into 
the table below to obtain the PANOSE Proportion digit for these faces:</font></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>PANOSE’s Proportion digit has very narrow tolerances 
overall for the different classification options. There will be several 
cases where common knowledge of historical typographic attributes will 
conflict with the categories that the measurements prescribe for 
classifying a face. In these cases, the measurements win out over the 
characteristic design of the face.</p>
                <p>Separate definition of the monospaced attribute is 
provided to differentiate these typographically constrained faces. A few
 typefaces will be isolated by the JMRat evaluation that are not truly 
monospaced fonts. Most prone to this error are modern faces with nearly 
even widths or condensed faces. Since character advancement width 
metrics are not evaluated in the PANOSE Typeface Matching System, there 
is no visual grounds for correctly identifying a monospaced font. If the
 face being classified is known to contain monospaced character widths, 
the digit 9-Monospaced can be assigned even if the JMRat test fails to 
validate this classification.</p>
                <p>Similarly, if a known proportionally spaced font 
happens to be isolated as monospaced due to the glyph design of the 
uppercase J and uppercase M, the monospaced classification can be 
ignored and the font can be classified by using the subsequent 
parameters. This subjective dismissal of a PANOSE trait is highly 
unusual and is an exception to the rule.</p>
                <p>Since the tolerances are so tight for the three 
proportion options of Old Style, Modern, and Even Width, some fonts will
 straddle these boundaries and end up with different proportional 
classification due to changes in their weight or style. The font should 
always be classified by the results of the PropRat variable in these 
cases, not by what the majority of the family is assigned or what the 
known historical information may indicate.</p>
                <p>Similarly there will be rare cases where a typically 
non-condensed face uses a narrow enough uppercase O glyph to be 
classified as a condensed letterform and visa versa. Again, enter the 
number dictated by the classification system, rather than the name of 
the font. There are several faces that appear condensed whose names do 
not contain the word “condensed.”</p>
                <p>Also note that extremely condensed or extended 
designs are usually classified as Decoratives. If ORat exceeds the 
limits listed above, it is good evidence that a Decorative 
classification should be considered (see Section 4).</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The Contrast digit describes the ratio between the 
thickest point on the stroke of the letter O and the narrowest point on 
the letter O. This ratio is called the ConRat and involves two 
relatively straight forward measurements.</p>
                <p>The glyph shape of the uppercase O is used to 
calculate the contrast digit because it is generally of higher contrast 
than the other characters of the alphabet. For instance, the thick 
segments of the uppercase O are wider than the thick segments of other 
letters of the alphabet. This measurement of contrast with the rounded 
character shapes is used because it emphasizes the contrast of the 
character shape, thus giving greater separation of visual traits in 
classification. The ratio of narrow to wide is used for contrast because
 it defines the degree of variation in the letterform as it changes from
 thick to thin.</p>
                <p>This measurement should not be confused with the 
sixth PANOSE digit, Stroke Variation. Stroke variation classifies the 
transition process between the thick and thin segments of the uppercase 
O, the relative values themselves.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><a name="_Toc380547266" target="_blank"></a>Measurements</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The contrast digit is calculated using two measurements, WideO and NarO (<a href="#Fig7UpperO">Figure 7</a>).
 These two measurements are often quite simple to determine. With 
advanced or calligraphic character shapes determining the location where
 the stem is at its maximum or minimum width is often more challenging. 
For this reason, it is recommended that a large sample is used to 
calculate the Contrast digit.</p>
                <p><i>WideO</i><br>
                  This variable is assigned by measuring the stem of the
 uppercase O glyph where it is thickest. Often this will be at the right
 or left-most extent of the letter-form, measured in a horizontal line. 
Note: <b>DO NOT CONFUSE WITH OWID! OWid specifies the character width rather than the stroke width</b>.</p>
                <p><i>NarO</i><br>
                  Similar to WideO, this variable is assigned by 
measuring the narrowest point of the uppercase O glyph, usually the top 
most extent of the letter-form and, in this case, is measured 
vertically.</p>
                <p>If diagonal stress has been applied to the shape of 
the uppercase O glyph the points of highest contrast may not occur at 
the top and bottom or furthest left and right extent of the glyph. In 
this case, WideO and NarO are the positions on the glyph where the 
difference between the inside and outside radials has the maximum and 
minimum value respectively.</p>
                <p>The rule for determining the radials for the purpose 
of this classification method is that they must cross the outer edge of 
the glyph perpendicular to a line that is tangent to the stroke. The 
radials can usually be determined by locating the character center and 
drawing a line straight out through the glyph. Yet, in some exaggerated 
letterforms, specifically flattened, rounded, or off-center glyph 
shapes, a center-based radial will not provide a measurement that is 
perpendicular to the stroke. In these complex character shapes, the 
WideO and NarO must be measured using the radial differences method 
mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This digit only evaluates a glyph’s contrast, which 
in this case is described by the ratio between the thickest and the 
narrowest points on the uppercase O. The angle of the stress and speed 
with which the character’s stem width tapers from thick to thin are 
handled by subsequent PANOSE digits.</p>
                <p>It is not necessary to record the location where 
WideO and NarO are measured to determine a font’s contrast. However, 
these positions will be required for later classification of the sixth 
PANOSE digit, Stroke Variation.</p>
                <p>While the contrast calculation does not require 
modifications to the measurement process for classification f italic 
characters, note that italic variations of roman letter-forms commonly 
have lower contrast than their non-italic counterparts. This can cause 
families to break across different contrast settings due to changes in 
the italic design. A simple oblique rendition of a standard symmetrical 
design will not effect the contrast value.</p>
                <p>Similarly, a glyph’s contrast classification may 
change as the weight changes. For example, a typeface classified as 
having medium contrast in a low weight design may have increased 
contrast when the weight increases. Similarly, if a font is classified 
as having high contrast it is likely that the contrast will decrease as 
the weight increases. PANOSE does not regularize these values across 
typeface families, but instead accepts them as a visual change that is 
weight dependent.</p>
                <p>A stencil, script, or overly decorative character 
that does not have a closed path, or form a continuous circle is 
classified as having a contrast of 1-No fit. This should be treated as a
 warning sign that possibly classification as Handwritten (Section 3) or
 Decorative (Section 4) will be more suitable for this face.</p>
                <p>Notice that some contrast can exist in faces that are
 classified as 2-No Contrast. This is representative of the fact that 
typefaces are rarely designed with absolutely no contrast. Even glyphs 
that appear to have consistent stroke thickness throughout the 
letter-form, generally employ some amount of contrast. The contrast 
classification of 3-Very Low addresses glyphs where the alteration of 
the weights of the thick and thin stems begins to become visually 
apparent rather than an optical embellishment.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The contrast classification of a given font specifies
 the relationship between the thicknesses of the thin stems and the wide
 stems. The Stroke Variation category further details the contrast trait
 by describing the kind of transition that occurs as the stem thickness 
changes on rounded glyph shapes. Two attributes of transition are 
classified, the angle of the transition and the speed of the transition.
 Note: If the previous digit (Contrast) resulted in 2-No Contrast, then 
the Stroke Variation digit is 2-No Variation.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><a name="_Toc380547273" target="_blank"></a>Measurements</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The speed of the transition of the stem weight in 
rounded characters is classified by comparing the curvature of the outer
 edge of the glyph to the curvature of the inner edge.</p>
                <p>PANOSE uses a unique and simple method for 
determining the conformance of any given ellipse to a purely oval path. 
These measurements are the most specific in the PANOSE Classification 
Metrics Guide and require extreme precision. Whenever possible, the 
measurements should be taken from a sample that is 400 points in size. 
Computer-generated 0.25 point vertical and horizontal rules are also 
very useful.</p>
                <p><i>OutRad</i><br>
                  OutRad(<a href="#Fig7UpperO">Figure 7</a>), or the 
outer radius, is a horizontal measurement taken on the uppercase O, from
 the center of the glyph to the right-most extent of the glyph shape.</p>
                <p><i>OutMid</i><br>
                  There are several steps involved in determining the OutMid(<a href="#Fig7UpperO">Figure 7</a>)
 measurement. The upper right corner of the uppercase O is used to 
determine the OutMid. The OutMid is a horizontal measurement that 
extends from the middle of the character to the character edge. Unlike 
the OutRad, the vertical placement of this measurement is not at the mid
 point of the glyph, but rather at a point specified by the intersection
 of a diagonal bisecting line referred to as the Inter-edge line.</p>
                <p>The Inter-edge line is drawn from the glyph center to
 the intersection of two lines, one horizontal and one vertical, that 
indicate the vertical location of the upper extent of the character and 
the horizontal location of the right-most extent of the character. On a 
perfect circle, the resulting Inter-edge line is at a 45º angle.</p>
                <p>With the Inter-edge line correctly drawn, the OutMid 
can be determined. It is a horizontal measurement taken from the 
horizontal mid point of the glyph to the point where the Inter-edge line
 intersects the outer edge of the glyph shape.</p>
                <p>In non-upright characters, all vertical lines for measuring distances are skewed to match the oblique angle.</p>
                <p>These two variables, OutRad and OutMid, are used to 
determine the curvature of the outer ellipse of the uppercase O glyph. 
These same measurements will be used later in the Letterform category to
 assign an overall character roundness value to a given font. To 
determine the speed of stoke transition, the curvature of the inner 
ellipse of the uppercase O must also be determined. The same process 
described above is repeated for the inside of the uppercase O glyph with
 InRad and InMid.</p>
                <p><i>InRad</i><br>
                  InRad(<a href="#Fig7UpperO">Figure 7</a>) is the 
inside radius of the uppercase O. This horizontal measurement is taken 
on the same line used for OutRad, but the measurement is taken from the 
center of the glyph to the inside edge of the right stroke of the 
character.</p>
                <p><i>InMid</i><br>
                  This measurement is similar to the OutMid(<a href="#Fig7UpperO">Figure 7</a>)
 measurement; in this case the Inter-edge line is drawn from the upper 
and right-most extents of the inner ellipse of the uppercase O.</p>
                <p>It is a common measurement error to use the wrong 
Inter-edge line when both the InMid and the OutMid are measured on the 
same sample. Always verify that the correct Inter-edge line is being 
used for the correct variable measurement.</p>
                <p><i>StressUp</i><br>
                  The angle of the stress of the rounded glyphs is 
characterized by locating the point at which the outer ellipse and inner
 ellipse of the uppercase O are closest together and measuring that 
point’s angle to the center of the glyph. Intuitively picture the inner 
and outer ellipses as rails; the goal is to see where a ball that rolls 
between those rails fits the tightest.</p>
                <p>Mathematically, the location can be found by locating
 the smallest value returned when measuring a line that is tangent to 
the outer ellipse to where that line crosses the inner ellipse. Once 
that point is determined, a line is drawn from that point to the center 
of the glyph. The line formed is the StressUp (Figure 7) value.</p>
                <p><i>StressLo</i><br>
                  The StressLo variable is similar to the StressUp 
variable, except in this case the measurements are taken on the 
lowercase o.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><a name="_Toc380547274" target="_blank"></a>Calculated Variables</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>There are three calculations necessary to determine a font’s stem transition speed.</p>
                <p>OutCurv = OutMid / OutRad<br>
                  InCurv = InMid / InRad<br>
                  Speed = OutCurv / InCurv</p>
                <p>The resulting Speed variable is then fit into the “Speed Table” below to obtain the transition speed attribute.</p>
                <p>Speed Table:<br>
                  Speed <font face="Symbol">³</font> .96 …………= Gradual<br>

                  Speed <font face="Symbol">£</font> .85 ………= Instant</p>
                <p>The stress of the uppercase and lowercase O (CapStress and LowerStress) is used to normalize oblique glyphs.</p>
                <p>CapStress = StressUp - Slant<br>
                  LowerStress = StressLo - Slant</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><a name="_Toc380547275" target="_blank"></a>Classification</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The stroke variation digit is 2-No Variation if the 
previous digit resulted in 2-No Contrast. If the font has contrast, the 
transition speed is assigned for the font. If the speed is less than or 
equal to 0.85, the typeface is classified with the Stroke Variation 
value, Instant. If the Speed value is greater than or equal to 0.96, the
 font is classified as having Gradual speed. Finally, if the Speed 
values lies between 0.85 and 0.96 it is classified as Rapid.</p>
                <p>The Stroke Variation classification continues by evaluating the stress of the uppercase O glyph.</p>
                <p>If StressUp is less than or equal to 98º and greater 
than or equal to 82º, the stress of the lowercase is also evaluated. If 
the value for StressLo is also less than or equal to 98º and greater 
than or equal to 82º, the font is classified as having Vertical stress. 
If the value for StressLo is greater than 98º or is less than 82º, the 
font is classified as having Transitional stress.</p>
                <p>If the StressUp value is greater than 98º and less 
than or equal to 172º, it is not necessary to check the StressLo 
variable. The font is classified as having Diagonal stress.</p>
                <p>Finally if the StressUp variable is greater than or 
equal to 172º and less than or equal to188º, the font is classified as 
having Horizontal stress.</p>
                <p>You can determine the stress based on the following information:</p>
                <p>Horizontal = CapStress = 0 ± 8, or 180 ± 8<br>
                  Vertical = CapStress = 90 ± 8<br>
                  If vertical check LowerStress<br>
                  if LowerStress = CapStress, stress is Vertical<br>
                  if LowerStress CapStress, stress is Transitional<br>
                  All else is Diagonal</p>

                <p><i>ArmAHi ArmALo</i><br>
                  The thickness of the left diagonal stem of the uppercase A is described by the ArmAHi and ArmALo(<a href="#Fig10AMeasures">Figure 10</a>)
 variables. These measurements are taken by projecting the theoretical 
stem edges of the left stem out to the baseline and capline of the 
letter. The ArmAHi measurement is then determined by measuring the 
thickness of the stroke at the capline. Similarly, the ArmALo is 
measured at the baseline. Both measurements are taken perpendicular to a
 line that depicts the middle of the stem.</p>
                <p><i>ArmCurv</i><br>
                  The curvature of the diagonal arms is captured by the ArmCurv(<a href="#Fig10AMeasures">Figure 10</a>)
 variable. This measurement is taken at the mid point of an imaginary 
line which is drawn from the point where the left theoretical edge of 
the uppercase A intersects the baseline and capline. This line will 
often be coincident with the edge of the stem; the cases when this is 
not true need to be measured. The measurement is taken from the mid 
point of the imaginary line to the actual left edge of the stem. In the 
case of a concave stem this will result in a negative number, in the 
case of a bowed stem this will result in a positive number.</p>
                <p><i>CapH</i><br>
                  CapH(<a href="#Fig2UpperH">Figure 2</a>) is the cap 
height and it is measured on the uppercase H, from the top-most Y-extent
 to the bottom-most Y-extent along the theoretical midline of the left 
vertical stroke. The midline is chosen to avoid serifs that extend the 
height or depth of the character shape. This is a vertical measurement 
regardless of whether the character is italic or oblique.</p>

                  The two CutCount (<a href="#Fig11CutCount">Figure 11</a>)variables
 depict the number of corners at both terminations of the uppercase C. 
This measurement is only applied to serif letter forms and indicates the
 amount of serif detailing at the ends of the stroke. The procedure for 
this variable is loosely defined so as not to impede the simple goal of 
this attribute. Each surface of the detail at the termination of the C 
that is not a part of the major curve of the glyph is determined. From 
these surfaces the corners are counted and those counts determine the

the upper and lower termination of the uppercase C.</p>

                <p><i>CutPitch</i><br>
                  The angle of termination on an uppercase C for a sans serif glyph is stored as the CutPitch(<a href="#Fig12CutPitch">Figure 12</a>).
 This measurement is not taken on serif letterforms. The angle produced 
by the two points that terminate the upper stroke of the uppercase C is 
used to describe this variable. The left-most of the two points is used 
as the fulcrum of the angle. In the case of a highly rounded corner 
style at the termination of the stroke, the theoretical edge of the 
stroke must be determined and its angle recorded. The treatment of the 
lower termination of the stroke is not factored into this attribute.</p>

                <h3><a name="_Toc380547282" target="_blank"></a>Classification</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Of the two traits that are classified in this 
category, the arm is determined first. The termination treatment is 
determined separately as a second process.</p>
                <p>There are three different kinds of non-straight arms 
that are classified in this category. They are: tapered (or 
non-parallel), bowed, and concave. Different variables are evaluated to 
check for the existence of these different arm styles.</p>
                <p>To assess whether the arms are non-straight the 
difference between the ArmAHi and ArmALo values are checked. This is 
done by evaluating the TaperRat variable. The arm is considered 
non-parallel if the TaperRat is less than 0.6.</p>
                <p>Bowed and concave arms are isolated with the CurvRat 
variable. If the absolute value of CurvRat is greater than or equal to 
0.02 then the arm is considered non-straight. Notice that the CurvRat 
will not indicate whether the arms are bowed or concave, only that they 
are not straight. The CurvRat variable will result in an error if the 
arm is completely straight.</p>
                <p>Next, evaluate the treatment of the uppercase C 
opening. CutPitch is used for analysis of sans serif faces (10 &lt; 
digit 2 &lt;14).</p>
                <p>353º &lt; CutPitch <font face="Symbol">£ </font>7º = Horizontal<br>
                  7º &lt; CutPitch <font face="Symbol">£ </font>83º = Wedge<br>
                  83º &lt; CutPitch &lt; 112º = Vertical</p>
                <p>The CutCount values compare the complexity of the 
upper and lower serifs on the uppercase C glyph. This step is overly 
complex for manual classification of faces. The CutCount values are 
helpful if you are writing programs to classify type. CutCount is used 
to distinguish between a single or double serif termination on the 
uppercase C. If a face is difficult to determine, use the rule: CutRat <font face="Symbol">£</font> 0.75 = Single Serif.</p>
                <p>The attributes of “Straight” or “Non-Straight” arms 
are paired with the attributes of “Horizontal,” “Wedge,” “Vertical,” 
“Single Serif,” or “Double Serif” to determine the final classification 
digit for Arm Style in the table below:</p>

                <p>Diagonal arms of sans serif letterforms will often 
bow when the proportion of the glyphs becomes very condensed, causing 
this extremely rare attribute to change within a family.</p>
                <p>Some fonts use a different topology for the uppercase
 A that resembles more of a inverted horseshoe than a triangle. These 
fonts should be classified as 1-No Fit for this category and may 
indicate a Decorative face. Check the family size and the availability

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Most sophisticated typeface designs alter the 
roundness of the character shapes in order to give the font a 
distinctive appearance or balance of white-space. This roundness is 
classified in the Letterform category. In addition to the glyph 
roundness, the predominant skewing of the character forms is also 
recorded and used to isolate oblique characters.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><a name="_Toc380547287" target="_blank"></a>Measurements</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The measurements that were used to determine the 
speed trait for the Stroke Variation digit are also used to determine 
the roundness component of the Letterform digit. Only the outer ellipse 
variables are used in this category.</p>
                <p><i>OutRad</i><br>
                  OutRad(<a href="#Fig7UpperO">Figure 7</a>), or the 
outer radius, is a horizontal measurement taken on the uppercase O, from
 the center of the glyph to the right-most extent of the glyph shape.</p>
                <p><i>OutMid</i><br>
                  There are several steps involved in determining the OutMid(<a href="#Fig7UpperO">Figure 7</a>)
 measurement. The upper right corner of the uppercase O is used to 
determine the OutMid. The OutMid is a horizontal measurement that 
extends from the middle of the character to the character edge. Unlike 
the OutRad, the vertical placement of this measurement is not at the mid
 point of the glyph, but rather at a point specified by the intersection
 of a diagonal bisecting line referred to as the Inter-edge line.</p>
                <p>The Inter-edge line is drawn from the glyph center to
 the intersection of two lines, one horizontal and one vertical, that 
indicate the vertical location of the upper extent of the character and 
the horizontal location of the right-most extent of the character. On a 
perfect circle, the resulting Inter-edge line is at a 45º angle.</p>
                <p>With the Inter-edge line correctly drawn, the OutMid 
can be determined. It is a horizontal measurement taken from the 
horizontal mid point of the glyph to the point where the Inter-edge line
 intersects the outer edge of the glyph shape.</p>
                <p>In non-upright characters, all vertical lines for measuring distances are skewed to match the oblique angle.</p>
                <p>These two variables, OutRad and OutMid, are used to 
determine the curvature of the outer ellipse of the uppercase O glyph. 
These same measurements will be used later in the Letterform category to
 assign an overall character roundness value to a given font. To 
determine the speed of stoke transition, the curvature of the inner 
ellipse of the uppercase O must also be determined. The same process 
described above is repeated for the inside of the uppercase O glyph with
 InRad and InMid.</p>
                <p><i>OTall</i><br>
                  OTall(<a href="#Fig7UpperO">Figure 7</a>) measures the
 height of the uppercase letter O. It is a vertical measurement from the
 outside edge of the stroke at the top-most extent to the outside edge 
of the stroke at the bottom-most extent of the glyph.</p>
                <p><i>CentDist</i><br>
                  The CentDist variable is needed to classify those 
designs that place the visual center of the fully round letterforms off 
true center. This measurement is taken by measuring the vertical 
distance from the baseline to the point at which the edge of the glyph 
reaches the right-most extent of the letterform. The line that defines 
the right-most extent must be skewed to match the character slant for 
this measurement.</p>
                <p><i>Slant</i><br>
                  The slant(<a href="#Fig2UpperH">Figure 2</a>) 
determines whether a typeface is normal and upright or oblique in 
design. The Uppercase H is used to measure the angle of the glyph and is
 taken between the outside angle of the theoretical edge of the left leg
 and the baseline. This value is then subtracted from 90 to arrive at 
the Slant variable.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Because two traits are being handled in this 
classification category, two separate classification processes are 
conducted. First the slant of the glyph is evaluated to isolate the 
oblique font designs. Next, the curvature of the rounded characters is 
determined by using the OutCurv variable</p>
                <p>Obliques are isolated by evaluating the Slant variable. If it is less than 85º, the glyph is considered Oblique.</p>
                <p>The following two steps classify the roundness of the letterform:</p>
                <p>1. Check for off-center glyphs. If the widest 
horizontal point of the uppercase O is more or less than 6% from the 
physical center of the glyph, the face is classified as Off Center. 
Hence, if CentProp is greater than 0.56 or less than 0.44 then the Off 
Center attribute is assigned.</p>
                <p>2. If the font is not classified as Off Center, the OutCurv value is fit into the following list:</p>
                <p>Contact = ……………OutCurv &lt; 0.74<br>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Oblique is a general classification that is intended 
to catch most italic letterforms and all oblique variants of sans serif 
faces. There are cases where a Roman face will classify as an oblique 
due to the amount of character skew that is incorporated in the design. 
The Oblique setting should not be assigned due to knowledge of the 
intent of the face, but rather strictly on the visual trait of glyph 
skewing. In the rare case where both the Roman and Italic components of a
 font family classify as italic you can override the classification 
recommendation given for the Roman.</p>
                <p>The roundness of a character as stated above is a 
very subtle detail that determines a great deal about a given fonts 
appearance. Due to the subtle nature of this measurement and its 
classification parameters, you can expect some families to break across 
different roundness values from the roman to the italic face.</p>

                  The MidE(<a href="#Fig5UpperE">Figure 5</a>) variable

 uppercase E from the baseline. This measurement is strictly vertical

measurement is also taken from the midpoint on the stem to avoid 
curvature or stem slanting that may be incorporated into the font’s 
design.</p>
                <p><i>CapH</i><br>
                  CapH(<a href="#Fig2UpperH">Figure 2</a>) is the cap 
height and it is measured on the uppercase H, from the top-most Y-extent
 to the bottom-most Y-extent along the theoretical midline of the left 
vertical stroke. The midline is chosen to avoid serifs that extend the 
height or depth of the character shape. This is a vertical measurement 
regardless of whether the character is italic or oblique.</p>
                <p><i>MidA</i><br>
                  Like the MidE, MidA(<a href="#Fig10AMeasures">Figure 10</a>)
 represents the distance from the center of the horizontal arm of the 
uppercase A to the baseline. To accommodate for extravagant letterforms,
 this measurement is taken at the horizontal midpoint of the glyph. 
Again, this is a vertical measurement and is not altered for italic 
characters.</p>
                <p><i>ACap</i><br>
                  The ACap(<a href="#Fig10AMeasures">Figure 10</a>) 
variable measures the amount of flatness at the apex of the uppercase A.
 Most often, this is a simple horizontal measurement taken at the upper 
extent of the letterform. In more sophisticated designs, it may be 
necessary to take this measurement at an angle along a theoretical edge 
for the upper apex. It is common to have a font design that contains no 
flatness at the apex of the uppercase A glyph, or where the apex is 
highly rounded. In these cases, zero flatness is assigned. Note: If the 
top of the A is serifed, project the theoretical edges of the right and 
left stems through the serif, and measure the distance between them.</p>
                <p><i>CapPitch</i><br>
                  Many uppercase A glyph designs allow the right arm to 
project through the left arm at the apex of the letterform. 
Subsequently, that projected stem is then cut back to lessen its visual 
prominence. The angle at which the stem is cut back is recorded in the 
CapPitch variable which is determined by measuring the angle of the 
theoretical tip of the uppercase A. This measurement (<a href="#Fig10AMeasures">Figure 10</a>)
 will generally be between 0 and 90 degrees, and should be taken on any 
design where the upper extent of the right diagonal arm creates a 
surface that is not a rounding point for the apex.</p>
                <p><i>ASerL ASerR</i><br>
                  This variable is a point-count variable similar to the
 CutCount field specified in the Arm Style digit. In this case the 
corners, rounded or square, of the left and right sides of the apex of 
the uppercase A are counted. A count of 1 is always entered for the 
single corner at the apex. For example, If the apex forms a clean point,
 both ASerL and ASerR (<a href="#Fig10AMeasures">Figure 10</a>) equal one.</p>
                <p><i>WStem(E)</i><br>
                  The E stem weight WStem(E) (<a href="#Fig5UpperE">Figure 5</a>)
 is measured horizontally at the x-height of the uppercase E, half way 
between the upper two arms. This measurement is the width of the 
vertical stem, or back bone, of the character. This measurement is to be
 taken perpendicular to the stem. In the case of an oblique letter, the 
horizontal axis is positioned perpendicular to the stem. Note: for the 
purpose of serif designs, this measurement is applied to the large (400 
point) uppercase I glyph.</p>

                <h3><a name="_Toc380547297" target="_blank"></a>Classification</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The classification of the midline digit requires two 
separate sub-classifications. First the setting for the midline 
placement is assigned, followed by the setting for the apex treatment. 
The combination of these attributes form the Midline digit for PANOSE.</p>
                <p>To determine the midline setting, first the constant 
midlines are isolated by evaluating the ArmDif variable. If the ArmDif 
is less than 0.08, then the placement of the arms is considered similar 
and the font is classified as having a Constant midline. If the value of
 the ArmDif is greater than or equal to 0.08, then the location of the 
midline on the uppercase E is further evaluated to determine the correct
 setting. If the EArm value is greater than 0.58, the font is classified
 with a High midline position. If the EArm is less than 0.45 then the 
font is classified with a Low midline position. The remaining fonts are 
classified with a Standard midline setting.</p>
                <p>To classify the apex treatment, the fonts with 
complex serifs at the apex the uppercase A are isolated. This is done by
 evaluating the ASer variable. If ASer is greater than 2, the font is 
classified as having a Serif apex. If ASer is less than or equal to 2, 
the apex is evaluated for flatness. This is done by evaluating the 
TrimRat variable. If TrimRat is greater than or equal to 0.6 then the 
font is classified as Trimmed. If the font has a TrimRat variable that 
is less than 0.6, the font is classified as Pointed. If the uppercase A 
glyph uses a non-triangular topology (i.e., semi-circular), then 
evaluate the middle apex on the uppercase M glyph. If it is rounded, the
 face classifies as trimmed.</p>

                <p>If a midline is classified as Constant, there is no 
indication of the height of the midline. This is correct. In most cases,
 the midline is standard or high, but there will be cases where the 
midline may be very low and constant. These low, constant midlines are 
correctly classified as Constant.</p>
                <p>A medium weight font with a Constant midline usually 
shifts its midline to Standard when additional weight is applied to the 
letter.</p>
                <p>The apex of many uppercase A glyphs occurs above the 
capline. It should not be assumed that the capline provides a basis for 
the apex flatness (ACap) measurement.</p>

                <p>Two different traits are represented in the X-height 
digit: the treatment of uppercase glyphs with diacritical marks and the 
relative size of the lowercase characters. The classification of these 
traits are simple and straightforward. Note: If a face does not have 
lowercase glyphs, it is a Decorative. See Section 4 for these 
classification rules.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Two measurements are used for calculating the 
X-height. The height of the uppercase glyph for the typeface has already
 been measured in the Serif Style digit by means of the CapH variable. 
The lowercase height is measured as described in XTall. Similarly, the 
uppercase is evaluated to determine how the glyph height is altered to 
account for diacritical marks.</p>

                  The height of the ARing character, “Å” (<a href="#Fig14ARing">Figure 14</a>)
 is used to evaluate diacritical treatment. This is a vertical 
measurement and is taken from the baseline to the upper extent of the 
uppercase A portion of the ARing glyph. This measurement does not 
include the size of the ring. In the cases where the ring is joined to 
the uppercase A portion of the character, the measurement should be 
taken from the baseline to the lower extent of the inner white-space of 
the ring.</p>

                <p>If a typeface has been designed such that extra space
 is allotted in the Em square for diacritical marks, the uppercase 
glyphs will not have to be foreshortened when diacritical marks are 
applied. The DuckRat variable is used to indicate when a font is not 
designed for normal diacritical use and needs to duck the height of the 
uppercase letters.</p>
                <p>If the DuckRat value is less than or equal to 0.93 the font design is considered to be a ducking design.</p>
                <p>The XRat variable is used to determine the relative 
size of the lowercase. The table below is used to classify fonts based 
on the XRat.</p>
                <p>Small = XRat <font face="Symbol">£ </font>0.50<br>
                  Medium = 0.50 &lt; XRat <font face="Symbol">£ </font>0.66<br>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>As more fonts are designed for international markets,
 the occurrence of Ducking font designs will subside. The reason for 
including a classification of ducking versus non-ducking fonts is that 
the visual height of the font is greatly effected by this treatment. 
Fonts that have been designed to include diacritical marks have an 
overall smaller visual height than fonts that utilize the entire space 
above the baseline for uppercase characters.</p>
                <p>More and more, fonts are being designed and re-cut 
with larger x-heights. It is increasingly uncommon to classify a new 
font with an x-height that is less than 66% of the uppercase.</p>
                <p>While the original PANOSE System included 
classification isolation of fonts which include no lowercase, this 
version of the PANOSE Typeface Matching System has moved such faces to 
the Latin Decorative family (<a href="pan4.htm">Section 4</a>).<a name="_Toc356813983" target="_blank"></a></p>
